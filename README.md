# Global Keyboard Hooks
Made with the fantabulious [keyboard](https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/) library by (BoppreH)[https://pypi.org/user/BoppreH/]
<br/>
<br/>

They run some code at the end of a list of keys bra'
<br/>
"b" -> "v" -> "w" will run the code 'Ctrl+Left + LShiftDown + Ctrl+Right'
<br/>
Go to the start of a word and select it!


## Path traversal
Only hooks keys needed, not the whole keyboard

## Performant
Smash those keys as fast as you want it will keep up

## I want Vim on my Desktop
Vim hooks in Notepad, Vim hooks in Firefox, Vim hooks IN EVERYTHING.
<br/>
Sometime soon my dream will become a reality.
